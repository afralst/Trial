\~18°C

1.  Got up (\~8:20 am). Picked light grey color socks with white
    stripe pattern to wear, a bad choice and my dismay of the whole day.
2.  Forgot to bring my earphone with me again. Thus only meaningless
    aimless browsing during my commute. Here to remind me to carry the
    earphone tomorrow.
3.  Blueberries for breakfast and mocha + salad for lunch. Healthy to
    some extent.
4.  Read some information about law degrees and accepted the fact that
    for everything there in the world will be competition and cruel
    struggle. Yet I do need to spend more time exploring the choices.
5.  Feeling frustrated about managing the juniors who are not proactive
    and underperformed. This means I have room for improvement for
    management still. Be positive.
6.  Went back to Tung Chung, my lovely little town. Still loving the air
    and tranquility. Glad to catch up with VG and SW and watched the
    made-me-speechless interactive show of black mirror.
7.  Did Regular jumping (20 + 20) in the house.

Already peeled off the circle of [2019 Jan 9] after arriving home,
typing this and will soon shower, go to bed.

#### Writing practice

I can’t help but feel sad about how we can not remain in the same
positions or ways of interactions as time flys and life goes on. Today I
went back to catch up with old friends VG and SW. I felt relaxed and
chilled to talk with them about our personal updates. One moment I got
the illusions of the old days never changed. However, I could clearly
feel the distance between us. I suppose the distance always existed, and
it was only my memory tricking me and made that part faded inside my
brain.

I was a bit nostalgic but I don’t regret and overthink about what’ve
changed or what I’ve missed. I understand the fact that time flies and
everything has a path to progress and evolve. I feel lucky for the
choices I made and the schedule I followed. I used to dream about a
relationship/friendship should sustain in its way forever once it
begins. Now I clearly see how unrealistic and boring it could be. It
would be a super difficult task to sustain a close interaction with more
than 4 people, especially for an ultra-introvert like me who hate
repetition when talking, but only prefer face-to-face conversation
instead of a blog/post of sharing. (Maybe I should explore an
alternative approach for approaching people who are important to me?)
For now, my method is to appreciate our shared experience as a precious
memory. Then embrace changes and cherish the time. Good night.
