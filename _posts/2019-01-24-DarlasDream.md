1.  Got up. Dressed and departed from home. The sky was bright sweet
    blue and I was going to work.
2.  Went for McDonald’s Chicken Cheeseburger. Today’s podcast on the way
    sounded dull. Reminded me of how important that I should take note
    to improve my speaking skills.
3.  Attended a talk this morning organized by company’s Vision China
    about one belt one road. The vagueness of the content reminded me
    what a waste of life was all this stuff. But still, I could not
    figure out what can be qualified as a worthy one that would not be
    “a waste of life”. Maybe such things do not exist in the real world.
4.  Lunch today with XR, EL and JL. EL just moved to Tsing Yi yesterday,
    a cozy and spacy place. XR was waiting for his MBA offer (which came
    later this afternoon). Glad that my friends have their directions on
    track, as one inspiration for me to stop my procrastination too.
5.  Walked home from MK East. Bought 3-dishes from the food court. A bit
    heavy.
6.  It was a bit cold tonight. I binge watched some episodes of TVB Law
    drama. Today it showed how a fellow / senior barrister obtains this
    title. Guess I have to admit the fact that interactions and good
    relationships with people are the inevitable essentials for the
    majority career path. What I need to look for are a circle of people
    and activities that best suit me.
7.  Regular 20 nos. of jumping, I will soon go to bed.

#### Writing Practice

My clock is ticking.

Last night I dreamt of an administrative stuff leaving a dark-blue
envelope on my office desk. I walked to my seat and picked up the
letter. “Attn: Darla”, the envelope said. I carefully cut the edge of
the envelope with scissors to avoid damaging the envelope or the paper
inside. Then the content unfolded. It was a thick cardpaper of
light-blue, it read:

“Darla. Get out! You only have one year left. Darla.”

Weird. I wondered if this letter was sent for the purpose of April Fool.
The spring was approaching, snow was melting for my roof, and the
scenery was gradually transforming from white to green. I presumed some
of my stupid friends sent this card to me with an pessimistic mindset
about the post delivery service, and that would be the reason why I got
this letter in this late March. I put down the letter and went to the
pantry. I grabbed a coffee from the vending machine. The weather outside
seems appealing. Snow with some bright silent sunshine. I went out with
my coffee. The moment I stepped out of the building, I got a instant
thrill: it was super cold. Then I woke up.
