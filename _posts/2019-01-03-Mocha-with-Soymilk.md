#### Mundane activities

1.  Feeling a bit worried about the eyes, as I and DM got the same
    unease feeling and mild symptom at our left eyes.
2.  Got up at around 8:00 am. Brushed my teeth and got dressed with a
    20mins podcast discussing whether democracy could be achieved.
3.  Tried taking the shuttle bus from home and then walking to Mong Kok
    East Station. A 1-out-of-10-level surprise that the shuttle bus
    stopped at City 1 instead of City 2 as usual.
4.  Brought my strawberries to the office and enjoyed them as a fresh
    start.
5.  Grabbed a coffee and felt warm that the cute long haired barista
    remembered my choice of coffee “Mocha, soymilk”. Short talk with AR
    and a 1-out-of-10-level envy for all of my friends having Netflix
    while I do not.
6.  Had team lunch for celebration of 2019 and my chartership. Ordered
    plenty of food and dessert. In the end, I was the one to finish 1/3
    of the dessert. Delicious. But the tofu (風沙豆腐) there was bad.
7.  Got a wedding invitation from JW, took several hours to accumulate
    my inner introvert battery to be mentally prepared and accepted the
    invitation. Did regular jumping (20 + 20) in the house. Justdanced 2
    songs.

Then I took a shower, then I am typing this record, then peeling off the
circle of [2019 Jan 3] and going to bed, with my tiny heater on for the
whole night.

With Any Sort Of Certainty-Official Toh Kay Video

#### Writing practice

I am now listening to Toh Kay on youtube. It made me a bit sentimental
among my depression. It reminds me of the carefree mental state and the
wonderful world\\connections\\relationships from \<Adventure Time\>. I
feel sad for having no faith that I can have that kind of deep
connections with anyone in my life, past or future. I am grateful and
feel lucky for what I have now, and I treasure my relationships.
However, there’s still this bottomless depression and anxiety existing
inside that drags me down. I suppose these negative emotions and
thoughts are normal and common for every ordinary people. Still, need to
find ways and attitudes to deal with it.

During today’s lunch, I got the chance to enquire BM about his choice of
getting some arbitration stuff involved. BM mentioned it’s a training of
logical thinking and detail-oriented mindset, and the traits would go
along with him for the whole lifetime. He mentioned he was trying for
immigration and was employed as an RA while visa application got
rejected. It was indeed inspiring to get to know how such a technical
master and contract guru were developed from just a newbie like us,
through constant reaching out, learning and exploring.

A post I bumped into divided one’s life to 4 sets of twenty
years — life’s all just fleeting moments. Nothing matters while
everything is significant. I need to calm down.
