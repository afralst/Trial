\~18°C

1.  Got up late (\~8:35 am). Sleepy.
2.  Grabbed mocha, drank it and did not wash my mug til the afternoon. I
    liked the remaining sweet scent from the unwashed mug. However, I
    have to admit the mug did not look good. One moment I was imaging
    how messy it would be for the internal surface of my stomach, as I
    could not ever wash it as I do with my mug.
3.  Took a nap after my quick lunch. I was incredibly sleepy and it was
    an unexpected long nap. Partially due to the quite environment
    thanks to the absence of colleagues around headed out for their
    lunch gather, and partially due to my lack of sleep yesterday. Thus
    will try sleep on time today.
4.  Walked home from Mong Kok East Station when off work. Passed grocery
    market and smelled life.
5.  Saw a vintage shower somewhere in MK when walking back. It looked
    fancy but at a fair price. I should explore more on those unknown
    shops in MK in the future.
6.  Finished TaiwanBar’s JustDance series video. Watched some Stephen
    Colbert and ChenWenqian. Got news about the tsunami in Indonesia
    caused by the eruption of a volcano. Learned a new English vocab:
    “Gazebo”. Worried about the earth and structure, feeling powerless.
    And the quote by \<Nothing to Envy\>: \
    “The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is just
    statistic.”
7.  Did Regular jumping (20 + 20) in the house. Jumping Jacks x100.

Then I am typing this record, then I will take a shower, peel off the
circle of [2019 Jan 8] and go to bed, with my tiny heater on for
the whole night.

#### Writing practice

What do I really want? People asked me to stop pondering on this
question and just accept the fact that there is no meaning of life. I am
feeling slow and down for my productivity and motivation. Is it because
I lack some sleep? Do I need to work out more? Do I need to work
overtime more? Do I need to go abroad? Even though I love this city, I
often feel drifting and have no sense of belonging. There are many
mundane things and the commercial earthling stuff made it even more
depressing. How absurd it was that I got to know there were some travel
agency companies organizing nonsense trips that only meant to exploit
the participants by pushing the purchase of useless shits. How can I
cope with endless marketing, desire, and stuff? Probably this
overthinking and existential crisis will stay with me for the rest of my
life, like the fat of my belly does.

Tonight I got confused and ordered hot chocolate together with the
heavy-tasted soup and roast duck wrap from PAM. I wanted to get the
South African Tea next round. Extremely sleepy, guess it’s a sign of the
winter coming. Good night.
