\~19°C

1.  Got up (\~7:55 am). Smile with gray sunshine and feeling warm for
    the foggy city.
2.  First time to go to Fairwood to have scrambled egg there. When I am
    about to leave I bumped into some colleagues coming to queue.
    Feeling hahaha.
3.  Lucky to have friends and D whose comments cheered me up to keep
    going for work. Shit happens all the time and that is fine.
4.  Tried the ready-to-eat salted chicken breast from Marketplace. The
    taste was horrible, especially when compared with the chicken from
    IKEA I got as the extra lunch.
5.  Did Regular jumping (20 + 20) in the house. 5 rounds of the mini
    dumbbell. And one nice justdance song.
6.  The Korean colleague from New Zealand was asking about Chinese Pop
    Songs as he bumped into one great song of Teresa Teng at YouTube.
    This is one interesting point and triggered me to spend the night
    listening and talking about old songs, feeling nostalgic too.
7.  Enjoying my foot bath now.

I will peel off the circle soon. Sleep. Good night.

#### Writing practice

I am always fascinated by this world — how can it be so chaotic while we
enjoy some many differences, randomness, and unpredictable things yet we
still always keep conclusions, theories, and expectations.

Today when I was on my way home, I enjoyed 30 seconds of a live show
near Shatin Station and it was a classic song by Beyond. As I walked
away from Mong Kok East Station and passing MOKO mall, one salesman
asked me if I have any interest in the credit card of his bank with an
appealing marketing campaign. I was interested of course and that’s why
I’ve already got that card, I thought. But I did not reply to him with
my thought but just slightly shook my head while walking by. In front of
this salesman, there was a guy with some foot disabilities, playing his
guitar for a pop song and singing. His guitar performance sounded nice.
But I did not stop to listen either. Then my walking track crashed with
one old lady who was walking towards me carrying a huge folded cardboard
box. When we were approaching each other, my brain sent me the signal to
change my direction and avoid this lady. The interesting thing was that,
before my body reacted to my brain’s command, the old lady raised her
hand with that cardboard box and pointed towards me, acting as if the
cardboard was a weapon to defend herself and attack me if I get any
closer to her. What a life.
