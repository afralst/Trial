1.  Got up (\~8:20 am). Took the (picture of the day) to DM.
2.  Forgot to bring my earphone with me again. Thus browsing the massive
    information database on the internet during my commute. Here to
    remind me to carry the earphone tomorrow.
3.  Mocha + salad. Good news from AR of the scheme a certificate and
    becoming MPCC!
4.  Full of work and the to-do lists kept piling up. I would say it’s
    enriching yet I do have a little bit of worry about being
    overwhelmed (normal).
5.  Happy to have TL coming to my desk and chitchat about her tender
    assessment in the isolated meeting room. Always think people are
    cool using the glassy meeting room (kidding).
6.  A nice dinner with YL and AY, I am so grateful that I was lucky to
    be able to work with them and have them as my teammates and guides.
    The food was good too. Ostrich meat.
7.  Did Regular jumping (20 + 20) in the house. And justdanced.

Then I am typing this record, then I will peel off the circle of [*2019
Jan 10]* and go to bed*.*


#### Writing practice

This is just a normal day for Darla. She got up early at 6:30am, made
her own coffee and drank it with a bite of chocolate brownie. The
brownie would be only as the size of four phone camera, otherwise, it
would be excessive calory intake for her plan. The breakfast is the
routine ritual to enlighten her with the sacred mixture of sweetness and
bitterness from this world. She would sometimes turn on the online radio
via her phone for news updates, usually focusing on things that happened
far far away from her residence and at the opposite side of the globe.
Or sometimes she would sit on her sofa near the window and read some
texts, either an expired newspaper she picked up at the lobby downstairs
or a short novel that she’s been keeping for quite some time. Sunshine
would come to visit her place quietly during her coffee time. The light
is her best companion.

Her neighbor Jasmine would go outside to dump the rubbish at around 8
am. She would walk 10 steps away from her apartment door, push the door
of bin room and drop the rubbish into the pipelines that convey the
materials by gravity to a centralized waste treatment center. Darla is
often listening and counting the steps.
