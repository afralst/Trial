#### Mundane activities {#fbd1 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="fbd1"}

1.  Got up (\~8:20 am). A bit smoggy today.
2.  I got into the office and seated. I unwrapped the blue plastic-ish
    paper of the mini McDonald’s burger and started my bite. At my
    second bite, EL the supervisor came to discuss something. There’s
    10ms awkward moment when he was speechless spotting the naked
    burger.
3.  Full of work and the to-do lists kept piling up. Got cheered up by
    Thursday’s talk with YL & AY. I figured that there being no clear
    filing system would probably be one major contributor for the
    inefficiency and mess I suffered from. Trying to sort it out by
    building the mundane but important filing system.
4.  Got off work late and took a walk for the way back. When passing the
    street full of grocery stands, I got mesmerized by the big apples
    under the red lights.
5.  Thrifty so I took only one big apple as dinner. Belly showed
    objection and made me consumed one of my sugary favorites
    —Sangjisheng sweet soup with egg (桑寄生蛋茶) later.
6.  Did Regular jumping (20 + 20) in the house.
7.  Tired mentally and physically. Spent over an hour playing
    meaningless SimCity when back home. Several times I closed my eyes
    and almost fell asleep when sitting on my chair trying to type this.

I found that I forgot to take off the circle of yesterday so I did it
today. Then I left today’s circle to my Saturday morning.

#### Writing practice

Darla seldom talks. Some of her acquaintances even think she is unable
to speak. She often has a lot going on inside her brains, the weird
imagination about a parallel universe where the other Darla is living on
Mars, and Mars is her private planet where the martian Darla took charge
of, including watering flowers, scheduling thunderstorms, and adjusting
the brightness of sunshine going through the sun-filter for mars. One
year the earthling Darla decided to write a letter to the martian Darla
to wish her a happy holiday for Christmas, she wrote:

*Dear Darla,*

*I am also Darla Linz and I suppose we share a common gene, look and
probably some similar relationships in some ways, as I am the alternated
version of you from the other universe and timeline. I enjoy drinking a
cup of coffee in the early morning under the smoggy sky here, and I LOVE
brownies. Do you do so too? I wonder how our characters differ and how
did these variations develop. Normally Christmas is a season when there
are snow, homey songs, and red hats. People, especially people who are
related by their blood, would gather together to fight the cold
temperature and everyone seems to be enjoying this fight. Do you have
that up there too? It’s also a season where one would like to convey her
care to her loved ones. As such, I am writing this letter to say hi, and
Merry Christmas. I know we are born with connections and not alone.*

*Yours,  
Darla*
