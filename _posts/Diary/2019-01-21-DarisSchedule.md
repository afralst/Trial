\~17°C

1.  Got up late. Still, grabbed McDonald’s for a powerful start of the
    day.
2.  Today’s 2 podcasts on the way to work: 1/ Trend of audio control for
    CES2019 + a business-oriented IT company to serve the civil
    engineering community
3.  Had the scheduled lunch with JT. I decided to leave it final and
    ended my trial here. Even after all these time I got amazed at how
    natural one can be as a pain in the ass.
4.  Worked for the architectural drawings scheduling. And discussion
    with colleagues about an E&M option evaluation. Feeling that I am
    not making any progress in terms of my own standard.
5.  Left work around 7pm and got empty-minded on the way back home. When
    on the train of East Rail line, there was a damn grumpy kid sitting
    beside me who kept monkeying around and his parents just could not
    take him under control. When reaching Nam Cheong, I walked across
    the gate to change for Tung Chung line. After 3-minutes waiting, I
    realized that I’d planned my dinner at home and there was no need
    for me to wait for another MTR ride. It was a sign that I’ve lost my
    brain on my way home.
6.  Watched some TVB episodes about solicitors and barristers. It seems
    that JW’s impression on this profession is correct.
7.  Drank hot chocolate milk tonight and feeling warm. After the regular
    20 nos. of jumping, I will soon go to bed.

#### Writing practice

Dari is working as a security guard. This is his second job in this
city. It is a nice and decent job that he enjoys. The estate he’s
working in is a new development, located in a remote new town, with
fancy lighting decorations and seasonal plants well-displayed for the
landscape. Residents of this estate are mostly expats or young couples,
who keeps energetic cute dogs. Everyone seems to be well-educated and
possesses good manners, smiles friendly to Dari when he opens the door
of the entry hall for people crossing.

Everyday Dari wakes up at 6 am. He goes to a Cha Caan Teng downstairs
and orders a set of an egg sandwich plus milk tea. Sometimes when he got
an unexplainable good mood, he requests for an extra egg tart. Or maybe
it is the random egg tart that can bring him the extremely good mood, I
am not sure. He sits in an isolated seat of the CCT, and he likes this
setup and finds it the perfect place to start his morning ritual: a
silent mind meditation. Dari breaths in the minor noises of the
CCT — people eating and drinking, newspaper turning around, waiters
ordering food, and sounds from the busy breakfast kitchen.
