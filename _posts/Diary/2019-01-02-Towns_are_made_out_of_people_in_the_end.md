1.  Got up late (\~8:20 am) and unfroze my feet with my tiny
    heater.
2.  Grabbed coffee and a nice talk with AR. Enjoyed steamed fish at
    Shing Kee Restaurant, ate 2 fisheyes.
3.  Checked water demand built-up against the development zoning plan.
    Found an interesting assumption made by others for counting 1 people
    per room as the population of the hotel in the demand build-up (i.e.
    a population of 1000 for a 1000-room hotel). Self-convinced that
    assumption could make sense as the hotel could hardly be at its full
    capacity.
4.  With the help from DM, explored the incapability of McDonald’s
    Mobile App. Luckily still secured dinner purchase of the popular
    10-HKD 9 nos. McNugget (which was typically either sold out or
    requiring a long wait) without a queue in the deserted mall of Nam
    Cheong.
5.  Emptied plum wine bottle to further polish the McNugget dinner. And
    strawberry for dessert.
6.  Made my dentist appointment. Feeling unease for my left eye.
7.  Did Regular jumping (20 + 20) in the house.

Then I am typing this record, then I will take a shower, peel off the
circle of [*2019 Jan 2]* and go to bed, with my tiny heater on for
the whole night.

#### Writing practice

AR mentioned today about his new year target — to make more connections
or deepen the connections with people. It’s a good one and an important
one. One of the most impressive sentences that impressed me in 2018 and
kept getting back to me was from [John
Green](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwqOvyfAZHc):

> Towns are made out of people in the end. And I’ve come to love a lot
> of people in this one.

(end)

Today the idea suddenly came to my mind that I should start to record
and leave some trace. I suppose it is a natural desire of the human
race. I’ve been accustomed to keep the thoughts to myself and let go
many of them. This made me unmotivated, and I still am to some extent.
Even now I have problem to come up with something that I can write about
so I am basically bullshiting stuff without actual contents and make up
for my self-established words target. There was some point I revised my
post and wording requirement, as I did not have enough faith for me
having to do this, or able to do this for a year. However, instead of
deleting the wording requirement, I am now trying to kill my
perfectionism and lower my standard of the content that I produced. At
least I met the targetted wording amount. This is a good start.
Hopefully it would get better.
