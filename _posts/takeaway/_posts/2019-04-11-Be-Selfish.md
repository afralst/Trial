A resonating talk by [Sadhguru at London School of Economics 20190327](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBR9ZJrgpUE) shared by a colleague AT. Nothing new but always cheering to reunit with a shared mindset.

> Let's create an absolutely selfish world: that means, what I want for myself, I want for everybody in the world.

* Be selfish. "Your society" is still YOU. 
* Human experience is 100% manufactuered within yourself.
* Be conscious of how we hold ourselves. 
* You can not create inner well-being by alterning external circumstances. 
* You are not suffering for your limitations. You are suffering for your freedom.
