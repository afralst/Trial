When I was researching for my decisions of whether to accept the part-time JD offer, I bumped into this article: ["Is Law School a Losing Game?" by David Segal](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/business/09law.html) in NYT which shows one-side of the reality with modest humour:

> Mr. Wallerstein and his fianc√©e moved back East after graduation, and he landed a job at a small firm in Queens. He says he was paid $10 an hour and worked for a manager who seemed to have walked straight out of a Dickens novel. Over a firm-wide lunch, as Labor Day approached, she asked employees to thank her, one at a time, for giving them the holiday off.
