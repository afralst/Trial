Technologies develop explodingly. What will happen for our purpose,
lifestyle, and social structure? Are we approaching the end?

* * * * *



Just notes and thoughts for the seminar. What is waiting for us?
Explosion of technology development.

Some random facts:

> * Korea is trying to give robots robot rights. Japanese guy marries comic character in real life.
> * Google glass may be further developed into contact lens.
> * Google, Facebook and other companies are striving for free internet all over the world.
> * North Korea is the last country without Internet?
> * South Korea is one of the brightest country during nights looking from the outer space. North Korea is without any light.
> * One human consists of 3G biological information. Nowadays a miniature USB can easily possesses 128G info.
> * Our phone is processing millions times faster than we do. Nobody now can beat the chess computer game, even the free version, with a human brain.
> * We could be the very first generation with the ability to manipulate the natural process ageing. (3D-printing basically already makes human godlike to shape and print any food, any body.)

If the technology explosion keeps its speed, if the prophecy turns out
to be the truth, where will human head to?

For “human” society, only the rich would get their personal robots and
enjoy a carefree life while the poor cannot find their jobs because they
could not even serve as slaves which would be presented by intellectual
robots. No doubt that the average people would enjoy a more
technically-conveniented life. Though I could see no contraction of the
great gap between groups. And as a matter of fact many people, almost
all people, still measure their happiness somehow through comparison.
And future worldwide monopoly and invisible surveillance would be
inevitable and so accepted by us in exchange of the free Wifi and the
idea of freedom.

If the singularity comes true, the technology blows. Will it lead to
chaos? Or ultimately lead to the scenes described in Time Machine by
H.G. Wells as the upper class become so delicate and the prole so
vibrant that the above-ground world would become a finely decorated
human farm？

What would be the meaning/purpose, or more superficially lifestyle, of
people still existing if we reach the singularity? To eat, pray, and
love? Just like any other animals, to get fed and laid? After all, is
there any difference between human and other species?
