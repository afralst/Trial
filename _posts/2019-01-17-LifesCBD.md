1.  Got up. Ate the sweet orange. Feeling a bit cold.
2.  Grabbed coffee. The mocha looked different. Every barista makes
    their own type of mocha.
3.  Lunch with Helen for some short discussion and sharing. Then we
    wandered around IKEA and spot the ugly pink pigs.
4.  Did Regular jumping (20 + 20) in the house.
5.  Feeling tired and messy for thoughts.
6.  *“Life is C (Choices) between B (Birth) and D (Death).”*
7.  A hot shower is one best gift from life.

I will peel off the circle soon. Sleep. Good night.

#### Writing practice

Darla feels that she can stop time. There are moments when she went
completely blank in mind and things started to blur out in front of her
eyes. She sometimes felt like this would be contributed by her extreme
laziness. If you forced Darla to go visit a therapist, I would not be
surprised if the therapist writes down “mental disorder of often living
in her own world” as the conclusion. She can sense the gentle breeze and
enjoy the softness of a mat, from which she experiences a great amount
of pleasure for facing life.

There was one time, she went out with her classmates due to peer
pressure and still, of course, some remaining friendship thanks for the
course works. She later realized she had kept silent for over half an
hour during the noisy gathering. The sound of the water boiling and
ready for the hotpot, the sound of a long-time-no-see prost and people’s
chitchatting to gossip trivial details. Darla could sense how the
timeflow slowed down during the gathering, as she wished it to be done
asap so it would be over. Yet Darla still thinks that time is fleeting.
