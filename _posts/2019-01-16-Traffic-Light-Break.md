\~19°C

1.  Got up (\~7:55 am). Smile with gray sunshine and feeling warm for
    the foggy city.
2.  Fish O fillet for breakfast at McDonald’s.
3.  Felt like shit after talking with JT. But have to stand it and make
    it better step by step.
4.  Lunch with Tuesday group at Ming General. Nice salmon.
5.  Did Regular jumping (20 + 20) in the house.
6.  Feeling tired and messy for thoughts in the brain about the choices.
7.  A hot shower is one best gift from life.

I will peel off the circle soon. Sleep. Good night.

Every time when I arrived it would be a red light

#### Writing practice

Mong Kok is always busy. It is a place filled with neon lights of all
colors over the spectrum, huge commercial logos and every kind of
service. It is a miniature model of the world, the earth, and the
universe. Darla walks along the Mong Kok Road sometimes. She starts from
the east side of the Kowloon Peninsula and ends at its west point.
During her waiting of the traffic light when crossing the Nathan Road,
She would count people passing from her left side:-

1.  a bunch of lousy shoppers who are always confused about where to
    carry out their next purchase and to consume their excessive desire
    and credit from their cards
2.  an office lady who just got off from their work and is heading to a
    dinner gathering with heels
3.  an old grandpa-aged man, wearing sloppy slippers and carrying veggie
    in a red plastic bag, advances slowly with the “I’ve seen it all and
    I do not give a single fuck” walking style

Darla is fascinated about how magical the traffic lights of the Nathan
Road are, she admires their power to gather all these different types of
creatures into one point and make them connected in presence.
