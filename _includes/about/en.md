#ABOUT THIS SITE

I would like to gather records for my own review and sharing with the readers, from career-related learnings, news of innovation about sustainability and urban development, to personal travels and the smallest serendipities in life. I will try my best to categorize posts with clear filing for ease of reading/filing.


#ABOUT THE WRITER

I believe that each person is versatile with complex and sometimes paradoxical thoughts, and difficult to be summarised in a limited linguistic context. Yet, here you can find some facts that probably tell something about me, and even relatable to you:

* I love taking showers and naps. I eat quite some takeaways (not so healthy, so I am working on my fitness stuff).
* I cannot do without music and film, though I often have no memory of big names. MBTI result suggested me as an INTP:-
 * I love deep connections and insightful conversations with people. In the meantime, I need extensive amount of time to be alone and recharge. My favorite activity will be staying home instead of hanging out with a large group.
 * I donâ€™t have strong beliefs in any theories (including MBTI, obviously) and religions, but I do appreciate their shine in certain aspects. I like optimistic nihilism, and treat buddhism as a life philosophy.
